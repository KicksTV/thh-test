    -Alumni Race SM
    The Alumni Race had its origin as the Old Boys’ Race. Although the first official contest was in December 1953, there was a prologue on 8th March 1952 when Thames’ annual match against Rugby School was widened to include teams of old boys from Rugby, Repton, Winchester, Uppingham and Charterhouse. The Old Reptonians won, with Chris Brasher of Thames and the Old Rugbeians being first home in a time of 28 minutes, 18 seconds. Fellow Saltires, John Wordie and Ian Fraser, also took part. 

    Eighteen months later - on 12th December 1953 - came the first official race. Uppingham won followed by Charterhouse and Repton with the latter providing the individual winner in R.M.Newey (28 minutes, 16 seconds).  Since then, the race has taken place annually and has been entrusted to Thames, with six men having taken the organisational reins: 

    1953–58:  Ian Fraser
    1959: Bill Straker
    1960–84:  Anthony Eady
    1985-94:  Andrew Stevens
    1995-2005:  Richard Clarke
    2006-date:  David Jenkins

    In the early days there was only an open competition with four-to-score. In 1986, a trophy for the event was donated by King Henry VIII School, Coventry, a generous gesture from the dominant team of the era (with nine wins in 11 years from 1979 to 1989). However, the donation of the trophy appears to have been something of a curse and they have not registered a win since then.
    In 1986, Brentwood School donated a trophy for a V40 team event, based on three-to-score. They duly won the event that year but after coming second the following year, they have never since been among the medallists. 

    In 2002, Westminster realised they had a fine team of senior veterans and so donated the “Chataway Cup” for a V50 competition, which they duly won every year until 2007. The eponymous Chataway has been a regular in the race for Sherborne.

    In 2008, Sedbergh’s legendary Norman Berry donated a cup for the individual winner of the race, which was won that year by James McMullan of Charterhouse and Thames, and the following year by the almost equally legendary Charlie Sykes of Sedbergh. Charles’ reputation was built on Sedbergh’s own famous Wilson Run, a 10-mile fell race held annually in March since 1881. In 1993, he broke Ernest Pumphrey’s  course record, which had stood since 1899. In between those two milestones, Berry had come agonisingly close to breaking the record on two occasions. 

    In 2011, Denstone donated a trophy for the V60 class and in its first year, no doubt to their surprise, they could only come second to Westminster. We await in due course a trophy for V70 and V80 events, reflecting the ageing demographics of the fit, semi-fit and still moving. 
    In 2008, the name of the event was changed from the Old Boys’ Race to the Alumni Race to create a more inclusive image. To date the numbers of ladies participating have been few but always of a high standard. We remain hopeful that it continues to rise.

    About 50 schools have entered a team over the full history of the event, some for only the odd year and some with incomplete teams. As can be seen from the results, a team will have a good run of podium places for some years attributed to an enthusiastic convenor and loyal participants, until a new bunch arrive to challenge them. The number of participants has slowly crept up and is now well above 100. 

    The race is very varied in the ability of those competing. At the sharp end there have been internationals in most spheres of distance running. Mike Berisford (Repton) in the 1950s was only the ninth Briton to be a four-minute-miler and Ben Moreau (Winchester) who won in 2004 and 2005 was a realistic candidate for the 2012 Olympic marathon. Thames members have always had a strong representation in race and at the front have ranged from Bruce Tulloh and Mike Turner in the 1960s to James McMullan, who won in 2008. Anthony Eady claims it is the only race in which he has ever seen a runner wearing a deerstalker, which must have weighed him down. Bobby Mill kept the back marker company for over an hour for many years in a fine kit straight from the 1920s and retired in 2009 well into his seventies. 

    Longevity is very noticeable in this race. Thames man, Roger Robinson, a cross-country international for both England and New Zealand, first won in 1964 and last won in 1980 and Richard Barrington, victor in 1971 and 1972, and Jim Forrest, victor in 1974, were both still competing in 2011.

       - Parkland Relays SM
    The Parkland Relays emerged from our 125th anniversary celebrations in 1993. To mark the occasion, it was decided that we would host a relay competition for all our friends and rivals in Richmond Park sometime around midsummer. Forty-four teams answered the call, and the first “Thames Hare & Hounds Parkland Relays” were held in overcast conditions. A fast, but nevertheless challenging, 3-mile course was devised, which included the long and testing drag up Queen’s Ride. From that first event, Thames emerged victorious in both the men’s and ladies’ competitions, setting in motion a dominance that endures. Tom Richardson (13 minutes, 51 seconds) and Rachel Disley (16 minutes, 3 seconds) , both of Thames, ran the day’s quickest times.

    Although the original intention was for the event to be a one-off, it was such a success that we decided to stage it again the following year. Since then, the event has really established itself and has become a focal point of our summer activities, usually played out in glorious midsummer evening sunshine. It has enabled us to forge relationships with many more local clubs, particularly some of the newer ones, such as Clapham Chasers and Wimbledon Windmilers, as well as the Full-on Triathletes. It has also provided another opportunity to engage with some of our longer-standing rivals during what, for us, is a quieter period in our calendar, as the epic battles with Belgrave Harriers in 2006 and 2010 showed.

    As of 2015, 22 relays had been held, with the only gap being the 2000-01 season, when the foot and mouth epidemic rendered the Park inaccessible. It was not the only one of our events to suffer that season, with the Ten Mile Challenge and Handicap having to be run over two laps of our five-mile course, the Common having escaped the restrictions. In recent seasons, a small move forward in the calendar to the first week of June has brought out more teams and now we regularly have 60 teams competing and then joining us for refreshments and prizes afterwards in the Club’s current watering-hole, the Telegraph Inn on Putney Heath.

    On the team front, Thames has been fairly dominant, particularly on the men’s side, with 15 wins (one for a veterans’ team) out of the 19 stagings. On the ladies’ side, both Stragglers and Wimbledon Windmilers have put together three-win runs, but our ladies have managed to emerge victorious on 14 occasions overall.

       - Surrey League SM
    The Surrey League is one of our main competitive events for the season. For both the men and ladies, our teams are currently in Division 1 and have won the title in recent years. The league consists of four events across the season (usually in October, November, December or January and February) at venues in south-west London or Surrey.


       - TH&H Challenges SM
    Our Challenge contests date back to May 1874 when the first Short Distance event was held. They are open to all club members and first home wins. There are four across the across the season:

    Short Distance Challenge – first held in May 1874 (first ladies’ contest in 1982). Nowadays, it takes place in mid-September over our 5-mile course on Wimbledon Common
    Long Distance Challenge – first held in July 1874 (first ladies’ contest in 1991). Nowadays, it takes place in conjunction with our home Mob Match either in October (when we host South London Harriers) or  November (when we host Ranelagh Harriers) over our 7½-mile course on Wimbledon Common
    10-mile Challenge – first held in March 1923 (first ladies’ contest in 2013). Nowadays, it takes place on the afternoon of our AGM over our 10-mile course in Richmond Park
    Road Running Challenge – first held in September 1981. Nowadays, it take place during the summer in conjunction with a local road race and in recent years this has been the Harry Hawkes 10 in Thames Ditton in June.

    The winner receives a Thames Hare and Hounds medal.

       - TH&H Handicaps SM
    Our Handicap contests date back to November 1883 when the first Short Distance event was held. They are open to all club members and there are five across the season:

    Short Distance Handicap – first held in November 1883. Nowadays, it takes place in mid-September in conjunction with the Short Distance Challenge. As a consequence, it is a mass-start handicap with the result calculated retrospectively
    Long Distance Handicap – first held in January 1884 and nowadays held in February or March over our our 7½-mile course on Wimbledon Common. It is a chasing handicap, so the first finisher is the winner
    10-mile Handicap – first held in March 1923 and nowadays, it takes place in conjunction with our 10-mile Challnge event.  As a consequence, it is a mass-start handicap with the result calculated retrospectively
    Midsummer Handicap – first held in July 1970. Nowadays, it takes place in mid-June on the afternoon of the Summer Sports and is held over our 5-mile course on Wimbledon Common. It is a chasing handicap, so the first finisher is the winner
    Clough-Whittome Handicap – named in the memory of former members Quentin Clough and Steve Whittome and held in the conjunction with the Road Running Challenge. As a consequence, it is a mass-start handicap with the result calculated retrospectively. 

       - Varsity Race SM
    The Inter-’Varsity Cross-Country Race is the oldest inter-club match still in existence and has a rich history. Barring the war years, it has been held annually since 1880. The first race was hosted by Oxford and run over a 7½ mile course which started from the Royal Oak pub and covered the Woodstock Road, Cherwell, Water Eaton and Canal areas to the north and east of the city. Oxford won by 22 points to 33 with Arthur Hernaman  of Keble coming home first. However, it was an unsatisfactory result as “Malicious boys tampered with the trail”, causing two Cambridge runners to trail home a long way behind the field.
    In the early years, the universities took it in turns to host the race. The Cambridge course started from the Hills Road railway bridge and from 1882 onwards, the Oxford course began at the University Arms on Cowley Road. The route was always marked out by a paper trail. About ten minutes before the race started, two “hares” from each university would depart and lay the trail for the “hounds” to follow. Unsurprisingly, this method left considerable scope for the competitors, particularly those from the visiting side, to get lost and this often happened. The most infamous race was in 1886, held over a massive 9½-mile Oxford course from the University Arms to Shotover Hill, then Wheatley Windmill and back to the city via Horspath. In that year, Frederick Philpot (St. John’s, Cambridge) was possibly denied victory when he lost the trail and William West (Christ Church) - one of Oxford’s top runners - trailed in 20 minutes behind the pack.
    After Oxford’s initial, and unsatisfactory, win, Cambridge asserted control and won seven races in a row up to 1887. Their dominance stemmed not only from a wealth of talent at their disposal, but internal problems that dogged Oxford. The Oxford University Hare & Hounds in those days were a part of O.U.A.C. and suffered from the prejudice that existed at that time towards the sport. The prevailing opinion was that cross-country work made a man slow for the ‘path’ and so O.U.A.C’s top milers and three milers were generally discouraged from taking to the country. Oxford were slow to catch up, but did so by the late 1880s largely due to the efforts of William Pollock Hill (Keble) - the first real star of the race and winner in 1886, 1888 and 1889 - who successfully combined the two disciplines.
    In 1890, after ten years alternating between Oxford and Cambridge, the race was well-established and the universities decided to seek a neutral course for the first time, largely because the Shotover and Gogs courses were regarded as “shockingly unfair” to the visiting side; Shotover with its fearsome hill and the Gogs with its notorious ‘ploughs’. The clubs chose Thames’ course at Roehampton largely through the efforts of Robert Conway (St. Catharine’s) who had run for Cambridge in 1883 and 1884 and had joined Thames in 1888. The intended course was the Club’s long distance one and very similar to the one used in later years, apart from one small difference. Instead of starting in front of the King’s Head on Roehampton Lane, the race began at the Drying Ground at the top of Roehampton High Street on Putney Heath with a straight run to the cross-roads at the top of Roehampton Lane. From there, it was down to Beverley Brook, across the watersplash, up Coombe Hill, down Coombe Lane to Raynes Park and then home via Cottenham Park, the Crooked Billet and a two-mile run-in across Wimbledon Common to the Old Well House on Putney Heath. 
    Sadly, the event was a fiasco as when the course approached the railway bridge close to Raynes Park railway station, the trail appeared to turn off under it, rather than turn back up Cottenham Slope towards Wimbledon Common. Thomas Colbatch-Clark (Trinity, Cambridge) followed this apparent route and all the runners were brought to a halt on the other side when it disappeared. Once it had become clear to them that they had lost the trail, the runners decided to run home in a pack and made no attempt at racing. The spectators at the King’s Head, therefore, had to endure an “anxious wait” and then had the “annoyance of seeing them trot home at their leisure.” A no-race was consequently declared and the match was re-run at Oxford in February 1891, with the Dark Blues notching up their third win in a row.
    After the disappointment of November 1890, the universities returned to the old format. However, seeking a neutral course was never far from their thoughts. First moves were made in 1895; however it was decided to wait for one more year so that both teams had hosted eight races over home turf. The fact that the 1894-95 season was a difficult one for Thames with the Club almost folding (see Chapter 4) and the 1895-96 one was not viewed with much optimism may have been a contributory factor in the decision to delay for 12 months. A year later and there were no such issues and the race was successfully staged on Friday, 4th December. Cambridge notched up a convincing 20 points to 35 victory, with William Gibberd (Trinity) leading them home.
    Following the move to Roehampton, the two decades in the run up to the Great War were really the first golden era of the race. The London venue and the ever increasing standard of the teams meant that it had started to capture the attention of the press and the wider public. However, the outbreak of war in 1914 brought it to a temporary halt with Cambridge leading the series by 19 wins to 15.
    Following a six year gap, the race returned in 1919 with Cambridge winning for the 20th time. The first man home was Oxford’s captain, Evelyn Montague (Magdalen), who went on to compete in the steeplechase at the 1924 Paris Olympics and was the basis for the character “Aubrey Montague” in Chariots of Fire. However, the 1919 race was perhaps most notable for the performance of Andrew Telfer (Selwyn), who finished second. He had run in the last pre-war race in 1913 and had been so severely wounded in the war that it was feared he would never run again. The following year saw the first change to the format since the inaugural race when the size of the sides was increased to six (although only the first five scored).
    Five years later came a more significant change to the race. Increased development on the slopes leading back to the Common in the Raynes Park area had meant that a significant part of the middle of it were run on roads between houses. Furthermore, the construction of the Kingston Bypass in 1926 was threatening to cut off access to Coombe Hill. Therefore, the decision was made to move the race and after much deliberation, the Horton Kirby course in Kent was chosen. Some of this course lay across land owned by a Mr Fooks, whose son Tommy (Christ’s) won the last Roehampton race in 1925. The first Horton Kirby race was held on 11th December 1926, with Oxford filling positions one to five and seven. In all, thirteen races were held at the hilly Kent venue up to the Second World War, when the race was brought to a halt again with Cambridge leading by 29 wins to 25. During this time Mr Fooks senior had done much to help with the race arrangements and was elected an Honorary Associate.
    The inter-war years also saw the instigation of the Second Team University Race - which soon came to be known as the Tortoises-Spartans match after the names of the respective teams - in 1937. This was one of the first second team Oxford-Cambridge contests staged in any sport and was the first step to developing the IInds-Vths races, which are now always held on the Saturday before the Blues Match and alternate in venue between the universities.
    Unlike in 1914, this time war did not mean a complete stopping of the race. From 1940 to 1945, six unofficial events were held. Due to the impracticality of holding the race at Horton Kirby, the race returned for the first time in 50 years to Oxford and Cambridge. The first race was held at Oxford in February 1940 and the last was held back at Roehampton over a new Thames course in February 1945. Cambridge were dominant during this period, winning five out of six.
    Following the end of the war, arrangements were made for re-starting the official series and the 55th race was held in December 1945 at Roehampton. The new course bore no resemblance to the pre-1926 one as increased traffic on Roehampton Lane and the A3 meant that starting the race in front of the King’s Head was no longer practical. It started at finished at the Big Holly Bush, close to where Roehampton Lane met the A3, and stayed completely on the Common. It was devised by Charles Faber and served to prove a point. At the time, Thames was seriously considering relocating to Claygate due to the increased development around Roehampton and the belief that the Common on its own did not give sufficient space for a course. Faber devised the figure-of-eight route that was to be the basis of Thames’ and the University Race’s courses for the next 55 years. 
    Cambridge won the first two post-war races, but then Oxford moved into a period of dominance, winning eight of nine to 1955. This was the era of Oxford’s middle distance stars, many of whom took part in the race. Runners of the calibre of Peter Curry (Oriel), Philip Morgan (Wadham), Jim Scott-Wilson (Magdalen), Ian Boyd (Brasenose), Tony Weeks-Pearson (St. Catherine’s), Alan Gordon (Magdalen) and, of course, Roger Bannister (Exeter) and Chris Chataway (Magdalen) all donned the Dark Blue colours during this era. Also appearing in the race, although for Cambridge, was the other member of the four minute mile trio - Chris Brasher (St. John’s). Chataway’s third win in 1952 was the famous fog bound race run in one of the last of the London peasoupers, which claimed 1,500 lives. The University Race had the distinction of being the only sporting event in London to survive the weather and was run over the special Thames fog course. Oxford recorded the biggest win ever in the series, 21 points to 66 .
    Following Oxford’s success of the 1950s, Cambridge registered a similar run in the later-1950s and early-1960s. This period was dominated by Mike Turner and his Queens’ College school of cross-country and the Light Blues excelled in both the University Race and British Universities’ Championships. Alongside Turner, the club boasted runners of the calibre of Tim Johnston (Trinity), Tim Briault (St. John’s), Herb Elliott (Jesus) - who was already an Olympic champion when he ran in the 1960 race, Martin Heath (Emmanuel) and Bruce Tulloh (Selwyn) and recorded possibly the greatest period of success the race has seen. Between 1958 and 1964, Cambridge lost only three out of the 28 Oxford-Cambridge races held (at this point there were annual matches for the Blues, Tortoises-Spartans and IIIrd and IVth teams).
    However, by the late-1960s, Oxford had recovered and the race was changing once again. Although it no longer occupied quite the position it once had in the athletics calendar, it was still the stage for a number of very talented runners, among them Henk Altmann (New College), John Valentine (St. John’s), Tony Moore (St. Edmund Hall), Bob Steele (New College), Julian Goater (St. Edmund Hall), Chris Garforth (Queens’) and Warwick Ewers (Worcester), who by 1977 had set a new appearance record for the race with seven (to be equalled in 2002 by Nick Talbot (University)). In 1970, there was a significant move back to the past when, following completion of the pedestrian underpass on the A3 at the top of Roehampton Lane, the race was once-again able to start in Roehampton village, this time next to the War Memorial on Putney Heath. Sadly, however, this change was only to last for five years as the King’s Head, the venerable backdrop to the race since 1896, was lost to Thames in the Great Fire of 1975. By the start of the 1975-76 season, new (temporary at first) Headquarters at the Memorial Playing Fields, Roehampton Vale had been found and the race was able to continue without interruption over a new course.
    The other major event of the 1970s was the beginning of the ladies’ race in 1976. The number of women at both universities had steadily grown in the post-war period and following the first Ladies ‘Varsity Athletic Sports match in 1975, it was only natural that the cross-country runners would soon follow. Initial plans – which came from Oxford - were made to have a race on the day of the IInds to Vths University Races the week before the 1975 Blues race. Oxford won that contest comfortably  and a year later the contest moved to Roehampton to join the Gentlemen’s Race. This posed some problems for Thames as it was at that stage still an all-male club and the interest from the Club at large was at best fairly lukewarm. Undaunted, John Bryant made sure the race was brought under the auspices of Thames and devised three mile course that took in some of the best landmarks of the men’s course. Since then, the race has always taken place in conjunction with the gentlemen’s match and, apart from 1984, it has always been held directly before it. Oxford won the first race by a maximum score of 10 points to 34 with Lynne Wightman (Lady Margaret Hall) the first runner home.
    In 1990, the gentlemen’s race celebrated its centenary and it was won for the fourth time in succession by Simon Mugglestone (Hertford and Keble), probably the finest runner ever to appear in it. However, the shine was taken off his victory by one of the biggest upsets in the event’s history with Cambridge registering their first win for seven years. The Centenary Race also saw the re-introduction of the Beverley Brook watersplash - gone since 1972 - and the first Old Blues’ Race, run over a six mile course before the two Blues matches. Six years later, the celebration of the 100th anniversary of the first hosting of the race by Thames Hare & Hounds was marked by a similar upset, but this time it was Oxford who ended a dismal losing sequence with narrow five point win.
    While the Oxford gentlemen had been struggling in the early-1990s, their ladies had been putting together the longest run of success by either side in the history of the Blues races, eventually securing nine victories in a row between 1993 and 2001. Winning the first race in that sequence was Emma Coleman (Magdalen and Oriel) who made history by becoming the first person to win for both sides, having previously been victorious in 1991 while at Newnham, Cambridge. The 1996 race was significant for it saw Stephanie Cook (Lincoln) come home first. Four years later, she would be winning the gold medal for Great Britain in the modern pentathlon at the Sydney Olympics. 1996 also saw the first appearance in the race of Ellen O’Hare (Merton) who by 2003, now as Ellen Leggate (and of Peterhouse) had a new appearance record of eight (four for Oxford and four for Cambridge).
    After the 2015 races, the match score stood at 63 wins for Oxford and 62 for Cambridge in the gentlemen’s race and 23 wins to Oxford and 17 to Cambridge in the ladies’.

      - When and where we meet MJ<br><br>
      The Club meets for regular runs at its headquarters on Wimbledon Common located on the A3 by the Richardsons Evans Memorial Playing Fields. There is ample parking by the club house. On Wednesday evenings we meet here at 7.30pm, after which we retire for refreshments and carbo-loading at the Telegraph pub on Putney Heath (although the Captain will occasionally put out a call for a different watering hole). Runs tend to last between five and ten miles.<br>
      Our other regular run is the Second Sunday 5 which also doubles as a 5 miles race. This takes place from the Clubhouse every second Sunday of the month and is free to club members. Entries can be made on the day or through the race website at www.secondsunday5.com. The route follows a fine 5 mile circuit around Wimbledon Common. Spikes or trail shoes are advised for the wettest depths of winter. The Club provides tea, muffins and camaraderie at the Clubhouse afterwards.<br>
      A number of Thames runners also do a high quality interval session at the Kingsmeadow track, Norbiton from 7:30pm on Tuesday nights. This run is a joint collective with other clubs across South West London. In the winter the Club alternates bi-weekly the track session with a road-hill session starting from Ham Gate, Richmond Park at 7:30pm.<br>
      Thames members are scattered across all parts of the South East and many have regular training runs of their own. All are happy for new members to join them. Please see [link to PDF] and feel free to contact any of the runners listed.
      If you would like to be added to the mailing list which lists all club training activities, please contact current Club Captain Matthew Jones (m4ttjones@yahoo.co.uk)<br>

         - Men's team MJ<br>
      The Club takes part in over 40 races from September through to July catering for all levels of ability. At the sharper end the Club takes part (and sometimes wins medals at) a host of local, regional and national level races. The mainstay of the cross-country season is the Surrey League series of 4 of the quickest cross country races in the country. The Club currently competes in Division 1. The Club also enters teams for all County level cross-country races and the flagship Southern and National Championships. In addition the Club contests County road relays and the London Marathon, where we have, on occasion, won the men’s team prize.<br><br>

      In addition the Club participates in a number of challenge matches against other local clubs, some of which go back more than 50 years. The oldest take place against Ranelagh and South London Harriers and are known as Mob Matches at which the aim is to produce the greatest number of runners and the scoring is designed so that the rearmost runner has the greatest impact on the outcome. All are followed by excellent teas.<br><br>

      The club hosts a number of intra-club handicaps, a Dash For Splash 10km cross country race which attracts some 300+ runners, the annual Oxford-Cambridge Varsity Match which is preceded by an Old Boys (and Thames runners) race, the alumni race of 300+ runners racing for their former schools and the season closing Parkland Relays, open to all Clubs and the traditional end to the cross-country season.<br><br>

         - Ladies' team AG/NG<br><br>

      The club has a thriving Ladies’ team and we are always looking for new members to join us. We compete in all local and regional cross country and road competitions. The focus of our winter season is the Surrey Ladies’ XC League, in which we most recently finished in third place in the ultra-competitive division one competition. Spread over four fixtures from October to February, league races are either 6 or 8km and are held at venues across SW London and Surrey. Whatever your level, these races give you a great opportunity to test yourself against other runners, to be part of a close-knit team and to improve your own running.<br>
      As well as cross country we also compete in road running, notably in relay competitions during the autumn and the spring as well as major road races such as the London Marathon.<br>

      If you are looking to improve your running, be part of a friendly & competitive team, and take part in regular races then we would love to hear from you. Our joining process is very simple and for a small annual subscription you get free entry to the vast majority of our races. To find out more please contact our Ladies’ Team Captain Annette Gould - annettejchase@hotmail.com<br><br>

         - Veterans MJ<br>
      The Club has a thriving veteran’s section and contests both County and National level veterans’ cross-country and road relay championships. In 2013 and again in 2015 the Club took home gold medals at the National Mens Masters’ Road Relays Championships and both men and women individual runners have taken medals at World Masters Athletic Championships.
